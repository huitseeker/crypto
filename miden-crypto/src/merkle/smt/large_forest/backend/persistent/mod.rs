//! A persistent backend for the SMT forest built with inspiration from LargeSMT's existing
//! persistent backend.
//!
//! # Performance Considerations
//!
//! Most operations in this backend need to perform disk I/O to the backing database. The
//! implementation does its best to mask this latency through parallelism, but some methods (e.g.
//! [`PersistentBackend::open`]) don't have work that can be parallelized in this way.
//!
//! To take advantage of data locality on disk, batches built using keys that share high-order bits
//! (e.g. from within the same lineage) are going to exhibit better read and write performance. Such
//! locality will also result in reductions to peak memory residency.
//!
//! ## Memory Residency
//!
//! As this backend does not store much data permanently in memory, the memory usage behavior is
//! quite spiky. Peak memory usage will be seen during a query or update operation, but all the
//! memory of that peak is released back to the system by the time the query has completed.
//!
//! Peak memory usage is proportional to:
//!
//! - The number of mutated leaves in a batch.
//! - The number of unique subtrees across which these leaves fall.
//! - The number of distinct subtrees altered by these mutations.
//!
//! This means that extremely large batches, or batches that are scattered across a significant
//! number of subtrees, will see higher peak residency than batches with good locality
//! characteristics.
